This package creates a python module called sciscipy.

It provides a link between python and Scilab by defining 
3 functions:

- sciscipy.eval(sci_cmd)
- sciscipy.read(sci_var_name)
- sciscipy.write(sci_var_name, py_var_name)

To increase the level of enjoyment, a python module 
called scilab is also provided. This package contains a 
class 'Scilab' that can be used to issue any valid Scilab 
command. Use it as follows:

>>> from scilab import Scilab
>>> sci = Scilab()
>>> (any_output, ...) = sci.any_func(param1, ...)

INSTALL
========

LINUX

$ ./setup.py build
$ sudo ./setup.py install

Debian/Ubuntu

$ ./setup.py build
$ sudo ./setup.py install --install-layout=deb 

$ ./setup

WINDOWS

c:\Python26\python.exe setup.py build --compiler=mingw32
c:\Python26\python.exe setup.py build install


To build with an other compiler (ex: clang)
$ CC=clang python setup.py build

RUN
===

LINUX
-----

the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable must be set, for instance to

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk/jre/lib/amd64/:/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk//jre/lib/amd64/server/
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk/jre/lib/amd64/native_threads/
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/lib/scilab
export SCI=/usr/share/scilab

See http://help.scilab.org/docs/current/en_US/compile_and_run_call_scilab.html


Ubuntu
------

it is not possible to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH 
globally so you have to create a file sciscipy.conf in 
/etc/ld.so.conf.d:

$ cat /etc/ld.so.conf.d/sciscipy.conf 
/usr/lib/scilab
/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk/jre/lib/i386/native_threads/
/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk/jre/lib/i386/
/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk//jre/lib/i386/server/

You also have to define the SCI environment variable in 
/etc/environment :

$ cat /etc/environment 
PATH="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/b
in:/usr/games"
SCI="/usr/share/scilab"


WINDOWS
-------

must include C:\Program Files (x86)\scilab-5.2.1\bin in the path

and set the SCI enironment variable to C:\Program Files (x86)\scilab-5.2.1\
