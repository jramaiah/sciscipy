This package create a python module called sciscipy
It provides a link between python and scilab by defining 
3 functions:

- sciscipy.read(sci_var_name)
- sciscipy.write(sci_var_name, py_var_name)

To increase the level of enjoyment, a python module 
called scilab is also provided. This package contains a 
class 'Scilab' that can be used to issue any valid scilab 
command. Use it as follows:

>>> from scilab import Scilab
>>> sci = Scilab()
>>> (any_output, ...) = sci.any_func(param1, ...)
